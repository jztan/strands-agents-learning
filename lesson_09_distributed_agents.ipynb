    "## Part 1: Agents as Tools Pattern - Hierarchical Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Agents-as-Tools pattern** enables hierarchical orchestration where:\n",
    "- **Primary orchestrator** handles user interaction and routing\n",
    "- **Specialized tool agents** perform domain-specific tasks\n",
    "- **Clear delegation chain** with focused responsibilities\n",
    "- **Modular architecture** allows independent agent modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Agents-as-Tools:\n",
    "- Complex queries requiring multiple domains of expertise\n",
    "- Customer service with specialized departments\n",
    "- Research systems with different specialist roles\n",
    "- Any scenario where coordination is needed between specialists\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture:\n",
    "```\n",
    "User → Orchestrator Agent → Specialist Agent Tools\n",
    "                           (research, analysis, creative)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Separation of concerns (focused responsibility per agent)\n",
    "- Hierarchical delegation (clear chain of command)\n",
    "- Modular architecture (specialists modified independently)\n",
    "- Improved performance (tailored prompts and tools)\n",

    "## Part 4: Combined Pattern - Distributed Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining **Agents-as-Tools** with the **A2A protocol** creates powerful distributed architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture:\n",
    "```\n",
    "User → Local Orchestrator → Local Specialists (Agents-as-Tools)\n",
    "                          \\→ Remote Specialists (A2A Clients)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "- **Flexible deployment** - Local vs remote based on requirements\n",
    "- **Scalability** - Distribute compute-intensive agents\n",
    "- **Integration** - Connect agents across different platforms\n",
    "- **Reusability** - Share specialist agents across systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use:\n",
    "- ✓ Some agents need expensive compute (GPUs, large models)\n",
    "- ✓ Some agents have proprietary data/access\n",
    "- ✓ Need to integrate agents from different providers\n",
    "- ✓ Want to share specialized agents across multiple systems\n",
    "- ✓ Need geographic distribution for latency/compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class-based A2A Tool** (Recommended)\n",
    "   - Discover agent card once during initialization\n",
    "   - Wrap as @tool for orchestrator\n",
    "   - Reduces repeated discovery overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A2AClientToolProvider** (Quick Start)\n",
    "   - Automatic agent discovery\n",
    "   - Natural language interface\n",
    "   - Good for dynamic agent marketplaces\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Direct A2A Client** (Full Control)\n",
    "   - Manual message construction\n",
    "   - Custom error handling\n",
    "   - Advanced streaming scenarios"
