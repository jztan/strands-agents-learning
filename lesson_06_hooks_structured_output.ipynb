Here's why these times are particularly favorable:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Spring (March to May)\n",
      "- **Cherry Blossom Season**: Late March to early April is famous for cherry blossoms (sakura) in full bloom. Parks and streets are adorned with beautiful pink flowers, creating picturesque scenery.\n",
      "- **Mild Weather**: Temperatures are typically mild, ranging from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F), making it comfortable for outdoor activities and sightseeing.\n",
      "- **Festivals**: Various festivals, such as Hanami (cherry blossom viewing) parties, take place during this time, adding to the cultural experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Autumn (September to November)\n",
      "- **Fall Foliage**: October to early November showcases stunning autumn colors as the leaves change, particularly in parks and gardens.\n",
      "- **Pleasant Temperatures**: The weather is generally mild and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F).\n",
      "- **Less Rain**: Autumn tends to have less rainfall compared to the summer months, making it ideal for exploring the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Other Considerations\n",
      "- **Summer (June to August)**: While summer can be hot and humid, it is also a time for many festivals and events, including fireworks festivals. However, be prepared for high temperatures (often exceeding 30°C or 86°F) and occasional rain.\n",
      "- **Winter (December to February)**: Winter in Tokyo can be cold (with temperatures around 0°C to 10°C or 32°F to 50°F), but the city is beautifully illuminated with holiday lights. Winter sales and events can also make it an attractive time to visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the best time to visit Tokyo depends on your interests—whether you prefer the vibrant cherry blossoms of spring, the colorful foliage of autumn, or the festive atmosphere of winter.\n",

    "6. **Multi-Hook Agent** - Combine multiple hooks (logging + performance + audit) on one agent\n",
    "7. **Tool Cancellation** - Experiment with `cancel_tool` in BeforeToolCallEvent to prevent execution\n",
