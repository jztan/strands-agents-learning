    "1. **Customer Support Graph** - Build a graph with intent-based routing (billing ‚Üí billing_agent, technical ‚Üí tech_agent)\n",
    "2. **Extended Swarm** - Create a 5+ agent swarm (add tester, documenter, security reviewer)\n",
    "3. **Conditional Edges** - Add conditional edges to graph (quality check with retry loop)\n",
    "4. **Error Handling** - Implement error handling path in graph workflow\n",
    "5. **Pattern Comparison** - Compare same task with Graph vs Swarm (which works better?)\n",
    "6. **Data Pipeline** - Build data validation workflow with multiple validation steps\n",
    "7. **Nested Pattern** - Create nested pattern: Swarm node inside a Graph\n",
    "8. **Shared State Tools** - Add tools that use invocation_state context (e.g., user preferences)\n",
    "9. **Cyclic Graph** - Implement cyclic graph with max execution limits\n",
    "10. **Code Generation System** - Build multi-agent system for code generation + review + testing\n",
