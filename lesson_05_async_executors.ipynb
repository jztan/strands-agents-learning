Downloads multiple files concurrently\n2. Processes them sequentially with progress updates\n3. Generates a summary report\n\nUse the cell below for your experiments:"

    "## 💡 Key Concepts Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Async Tools** - Use `async def` with `yield` for streaming progress\n",
    "- **Streaming** - `agent.stream_async()` for real-time event consumption\n",
    "- **ConcurrentToolExecutor** - Parallel execution for independent operations (1.4-1.5x speedup)\n",
    "- **SequentialToolExecutor** - Ordered execution for dependent operations\n",
    "- **Multi-modal** - Process images with `image_reader` tool, extract text via OCR\n",
